# Release v1.0.0-alpha.4

## 🚀 Performance
*   **Async Image Loading**: Replaced synchronous `BitmapFactory.decodeFile` calls with **Coil** to fix main-thread blocking and frame drops when scrolling lists with images.
*   **List Optimization**: Added stable keys to `LazyColumn` items, reducing unnecessary recompositions.

## 🛡️ Security
*   **Strict Device Lock Enforcement**: The updated `AuthActivity` now strictly checks for a secure Lock Screen (PIN/Pattern/Biometrics). If the device is unsecured, the app will refuse to launch to protect the encryption keys.
*   **Fallback Handling**: Closed a security loophole where the app might proceed without authentication if biometrics were not enrolled.

## 🛠️ Development & Database
*   **Schema Export**: Enabled Room schema export to `app/schemas` directory for better version control and migration tracking.
*   **Placeholder UI**: Added a default placeholder for images while they are loading.
