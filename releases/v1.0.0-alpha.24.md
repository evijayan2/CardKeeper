# v1.0.0-alpha.24 Release Notes

**Secure Backup & Restore**

This release introduces a critical feature for data management and safety: **Encrypted Backup and Restore**. You can now export your entire vault to a portable file and restore it on any device.

## Key Changes

### 🛡️ Secure Backup & Restore
*   **Export to ZIP**: Create a password-protected backup file (`kards_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.zip`) containing all your data and images.
*   **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: The backup archive is fully encrypted using a key derived from your custom backup password. Your data remains secure even outside the app.
*   **Cross-Device Migration**: Easily move your data to a new phone by exporting from the old device and importing on the new one.
*   **Encrypted Image Handling**: Card images are decrypted from the secure store and re-encrypted into the backup archive, ensuring they never sit on disk in plaintext during the process.

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements
*   **Serialization**: Implemented `kotlinx.serialization` across all data models for robust JSON handling.
*   **Unified Backup Manager**: A new `AndroidBackupManager` handles the complex orchestration of database querying, image decryption, zip streamlining, and encryption.

## How to use
1.  Go to **Settings > Data Management**.
2.  Tap **Export Data**, set a password, and save the file.
3.  To restore, tap **Import Data**, select the file, and enter your password.
